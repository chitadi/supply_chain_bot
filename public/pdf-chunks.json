But what is the \nbenefit of understanding the value adding from the supply chain perspective? Why managing supply chain is becoming \nnecessary  and  important  to  today’s  business  success?  These  are  some  of  the  fundamental  questions  that  must  be  first \naddressed before discussing the “how to” questions. \nOver  the  last  three  decades,  the  concept  and  theory  of  business  management  have  undergone  profound  changes  and \ndevelopment.  Many  old  ways  of  doing  business  have  been  challenged  and  many  new  ideas  and  approaches  have  been \ncreated,  among  them  are  business  process  re-engineering,  strategic  management,  lean  thinking,  agile  manufacturing, \nbalanced  scorecard,  blue  ocean  strategy,  ...  just  to  name  a  few.

Supply  chain  management  is  undoubtedly  one  of  those \nnew and well grown management approaches emerged and rapidly developed across all industries around the world. \nThe earliest appearance of the term ‘supply chain management’ as we know it today published in recognisable media and \nliteratures can be traced back to the early 1980s. More precisely, it first appeared in a Financial Times article written by \nOliver and Webber in 1982 describing the range of activities performed by the organization in procuring and managing \nsupplies. However the early publications of supply chain management in the 1980s were mainly focused on purchasing \nactivities and cost reduction related activities.

The major development and the significant increases of publications in the \nareas  of  supply  chain  integration  and  supplier-buyer  relationship  came  in  1990s  when  the  concept  as  we  know  it  today \nwas gradually established.\nIt  is  therefore  clear  that  supply  chain  management  is  not  one  of  the  legacy  academic  subjects  existed  for  hundreds  or \nthousands of years, but rather a young and even nascent subject. It is only recently that business world started making use \nof this concept. So, the question is “Why now?” A convincing answer to this question is that our business environment has \nchanged, which includes globalisation, more severe competition, heightened customer expectation, technological impact \nand  geopolitical  factors  and  so  on.

Managers must therefore understand that their \nbusinesses  are  only  part  of  the  supply  chains  that  they  participated  and  it  is  the  supply  chain  that  wins  or  loses  the \ncompetition.\nThus, the arena of competition is moving from ‘organisation against organisation’ to ‘supply chain against supply chain’. \nThe survival of any business today is no longer solely dependent on its own ability to compete but rather on the ability \nto  cooperate  within  the  supply  chain.  The  seemingly  independent  relation  between  the  organisations  within  the  supply \nchain becomes ever more interdependent.

Based on that, the author would like to offer \nhis definition of SC here and SCM in the next section.\n \nIn this definition, there are a number of key characteristics that have been used to portrait a supply chain. First, a supply \nchain  is  formed  and  can  only  be  formed  if  there  are  more  than  one  participating  companies.  Second,  the  participating \ncompanies  within  a  supply  chain  normally  do  not  belong  to  the  same  business  ownership,  and  hence  there  is  a  legal \nindependence in between.

The  link  on  the  upstream  side  of  the \nmaterial flow is the supplier’s supplier; and on the downstream side of the material flow is the customer.

Thus, \nthe fundamental reason of a supply chain’s existence is hinged on to serving the end-consumer in the market place. The \ndegree of how well a supply chain can serve their consumer ultimately defines its competitive edge in the market place.\nIt is understandable that in real-world a supply chain is much more complex than the one depicted in Figure1. It is not \nreally a “chain”, rather it is more like a “network”, when you consider that there are usually multiple suppliers and multiple \ncustomers  for  each  participating  companies  in  the  chain.  There  are  also  possible  nested  chains  within  the  chains.  For \nexample an engine manufacturing supply chain is a nested supply chain within the connected automobile supply c",

If you view a supply chain as basically a chain of value adding activities, you may like to call it “Value Chain”; if \nyou perceive a supply chain as continuous demands originated from the consumer and stretched to upstream suppliers, \nyou may like to call the supply chain the “Demand Chain”.\nSince the business connections between organisations are pervasive, how could one draw a boundary of a supply chain? \nIn order to answer this question, one needs to understand the four intrinsic flows of a supply chain. \nMaterial Flow: All manufacturing supply chains have material flows from the raw materials at the beginning of the supply \nchain  to  the  finished  pr",

As shown in Figure 14 the mass supply structure is very flat. The mass producer takes on \nthe assembly of the whole vehicle as well as many subsystems and modules. Thus the level of outsourcing is relatively low.\nFigure 14. Mass supply chain structure.\nThe mass producer will design the parts to be made by the suppliers.

When  the  cost  reduced,  assuming  the  output  of  the  supply  chain  remains  the  same,  the  supply  chain  efficiency \nimproves  and  cost-to-serve  reduces.  It  is  crucial  that  waste  must  be  assessed  from  supply  chain  perspective  not  from  a \ncompany’s  own  individual  perspective.  For  example,  a  company  may  move  the  inventory  responsibility  to  the  supplier \nin order to reduce its own the inventory holding cost. This may seem to be a ‘waste’ or cost reduction activity. However, \nfrom  a  supply  chain  perspective,  the  inventory  holding  cost  has",

It is a system approach.\nThe characteristics focus perspective classifies the purchasing function into four stages:\n•\tStage one is ‘passive’ in character. In this stage the purchasing can be defined as lack of strategic directions \nand is mainly reactive to operational requirements. High proportion of purchasing manager’s time is on \nroutine operations with low visibility to the supply chain.

Three key \nchallenges have been identified and discussed here.\n8.1 Creating Customer Centric Supply Chain\nThe first challenge that the supply chain managers are facing is to transform the supply chains from supplier-centric to \ncustomer-centric. Traditionally, supply chains have been developed from factory outwards so that the company’s business \nmodel may be continued without major change.

The supply chain includes not only the manufacturer and suppliers, but also transporters, \nwarehouses, retailers, and even customers themselves.

The distributor, in turn, is stocked by the manufacturer (say, Procter & Gamble \n[P&G] in this case). The P&G manufacturing plant receives raw material from a variety of sup-\npliers, which may themselves have been supplied by lower-tier suppliers. For example, packag-\ning  material  may  come  from  Pactiv  Corporation,  whereas  Pactiv  receives  raw  materials  to  \nmanufacture the packaging from other suppliers. This supply chain is illustrated in Figure 1-1, \nwith the arrows corresponding to the direction of physical product flow.\nA supply chain is dynamic and involves the constant flow of information, product, and \nfunds among different stages.

Walmart transfers \nfunds to the distributor after the replenishment. The distributor also provides pricing infor-\nmation and sends delivery schedules to Walmart. Walmart may send back packaging mate-\nrial to be recycled. Similar information, material, and fund flows take place across the entire \nsupply chain.\nIn another example, when a customer makes a purchase online from Amazon, the supply \nchain includes, among others, the customer, Amazon’s website, the Amazon warehouse, and all \nof Amazon’s suppliers and their suppliers.

Stages further up the supply chain use customer \norder information to fill the request. That process involves an additional flow of information, \nproduct, and funds among various stages of the supply chain.\nThese examples illustrate that the customer is an integral part of the supply chain. In fact, \nthe primary purpose of any supply chain is to satisfy customer needs and, in the process, generate \nprofit  for  itself.  The  term  supply  chain  conjures  up  images  of  product  or  supply  moving  from  \nsuppliers to manufacturers to distributors to retailers to customers along a chain.

The term supply chain may also imply that only one \nplayer is involved at each stage. In reality, a manufacturer may receive material from several sup-\npliers  and  then  supply  several  distributors.  Thus,  most  supply  chains  are  actually  networks.

In the 1990s, paint supply \nchains were restructured so mixing of colors was done at retail stores after customers placed their \norders. In other words, color mixing was shifted from the push to the pull phase of the supply \nchain even though base preparation and packing of cans were still performed in the push phase. \nThe result is that customers are always able to get the color of their choice, whereas total paint \ninventories across the supply chain have declined.\nsupply Chain macro processes in a Firm\nAll supply chain processes discussed in the two process views and throughout this book can be \nclassified ",

A key issue facing Toyota is the design of its \nglobal production and distribution network. Part of Toyota’s global strategy is to open factories \nin every market it serves. Toyota must decide what the production capability of each of the facto-\nries will be, as this has a significant impact on the desired distribution system. At one extreme, \neach plant can be equipped only for local production. At the other extreme, each plant is capable \nof supplying every market. Before 1996, Toyota used specialized local factories for each market. \nAfter the Asian financial crisis in 1996–97, Toyota redesigned its plants so it could also export to \nmarkets  that  remain  strong  when  the  local  market  weakens.

Toyota has worked hard to increase commonality in parts \nused  around  the  globe.  Although  this  has  helped  the  company  lower  costs  and  improve  parts  \navailability, common parts caused significant difficulty when one of the parts had to be recalled. \nIn 2009, Toyota had to recall about 12 million cars using common parts across North America, \nEurope, and Asia, causing significant damage to the brand as well as to the finances.\n\n28 Chapter 1 • Understanding the Supply Chain\nAny global manufacturer",

For example, both the supplier and the manufacturer in a supply chain may prefer \nto have the other side hold most of the inventory, with the goal of improving their own profits. If \nthe two parties cannot look beyond their own profits, the more powerful party will simply force \nthe other to hold inventories without any regard for where inventories are best held. The result is \na decrease in the supply chain surplus—the total pie that both parties get to share.\nThe intercompany scope proposes a different approach. Instead of just forcing the inven-\ntory  onto  the  weaker  party,  the  two  parties  work  together  to  reduce  the  amount  of  inventory  \nrequired.

The  higher  the  supply  chain  surplus,  the  more  \ncompetitive the supply chain is.\nKey Point\nThe intercompany scope of strategic fit requires firms to evaluate every action in the context of the entire \nsupply chain.

A  supply  chain’s  performance  in  terms  of  responsiveness  and  efficiency  is  based  on  the  \ninteraction between the following logistical and cross-functional drivers of supply chain perfor-\nmance: facilities, inventory, transportation, information, sourcing, and pricing.

The two major types of facilities are production sites and stor-\nage sites. Decisions regarding the role, location, capacity, and flexibility of facilities have a sig-\nnificant impact on the supply chain’s performance. For example, in 2013, Amazon increased the \nnumber  of  warehousing  facilities  (and,  as  a  result,  experienced  an  increase  in  PP&E)  located  \nclose to customers to improve its responsiveness.

As  a  result,  the  company  is  very  responsive  but  carries  low  \nlevels of inventory.\n3. Transportation entails  moving  inventory  from  point  to  point  in  the  supply  chain.  \nTransportation can take the form of many combinations of modes and routes, each with its own \nperformance characteristics.

Sourcing is the choice of who will perform a particular supply chain activity, such as \nproduction,  storage,  transportation,  or  the  management  of  information.  At  the  strategic  level,  \nthese decisions determine what functions a firm performs and what functions the firm outsources. \nSourcing decisions affect both the responsiveness and efficiency of a supply chain.

In general, managers should \naim to reduce inventory in ways that do not increase cost or reduce responsiveness.\nInventory also has a significant impact on the material flow time in a supply chain. Mate-\nrial flow time is the time that elapses between the point at which material enters the supply chain \nto the point at which it exits. For a supply chain, throughput is the rate at which sales occur. If \ninventory is represented by I, flow time by T, and throughput by D, the three can be related using \nLittle’s law as follows:\n I=DT (3.1)\nFor example, if an Amazon warehouse holds 100,000 units in inventory and sells 1,000 units \ndaily, Little’s law tells us that the average unit will spend 100,000>1,000 = 100 days in inven",

The rating system had proved to be \nespecially accurate, and 60 percent of all Netflix users selected their movies based on recommenda-\ntions tailored to their individual tastes.\n1\n The company used its recommendation technology to keep \nthe DVD shipments moving and a greater number of its older DVD titles in circulation.\n1\nClive  Thompson,  “If",

Blue  Nile  then  displayed  all  stones  in  inventory  \nthat  fit  the  customer’s  desired  profile.

Blue  Nile  also  allowed  customers  to  \nhave their questions resolved on the phone by sales reps \nwho  did  not  work  on  commission.

What fraction of this capacity should \nbe flexible?\nIf uncertainty is ignored, a manager will always sign long-term contracts (because they are \ntypically cheaper) and avoid all flexible or backup capacity (because it is more expensive).

Thus, the forecast error (or demand uncertainty) is a key input into most supply \nchain decisions. Unfortunately, most firms do not maintain any estimates of forecast error.\n2.

For  example,  if  a  store  manager  places  an  order  by  10  a.m.,  the  order  is  delivered  by   \n7 p.m. the same day. Therefore, the manager has to forecast what will sell that night only less \nthan 12 hours before the actual sale. The short lead time allows a manager to take into account \ncurrent information that could affect product sales, such as the weather. This forecast is likely to \nbe more accurate than if the store manager had to forecast demand a week in advance.\n3. Aggregate forecasts are usually more accurate than disaggregate forecasts, as they tend to \nhave a smaller standard deviation of error relative to the mean.

What a firm knows about its \ncustomers’ past behavior, however, sheds light on their future behavior. Demand does not arise in \na vacuum.

Aggregate  planning,  as  the  name  suggests,  solves  problems  involving  \naggregate decisions rather than stock-keeping unit (SKU)-level decisions.

This level of \ndetail makes aggregate planning a useful tool for thinking about decisions with an intermedi-\nate time frame of between roughly 3 and 18 months.

Although this approach is not necessarily optimal, it is simple to \nimplement and allows for a feasibility check.

We know that the production constraint is feasible \nat  the  aggregate  level,  but  we  will  need  to  check  feasibility  at  the  disaggregate  level.  The  first  \nstep is to divide the production quantity of 2,560 across the six families. We do so in the ratio of \nexpected sales (using percentage share from Table 8-1), as shown in Table 8-9 (see worksheet \nChapter8-Table8-9). Thus, the plan is to produce 256 units of Family A in Period 1 because it \nrepresents 10 percent of sales. The next step is to identify the number of planned batches for each \nfamily. To get the feasibility of the plan, we divide the planned production quantity by the aver-\nage  batch  size  and  then  round  the  answer  down.

We similarly obtain the \nplanned number of setups (batches) for each of the other families in Period 1, as shown in Table \n8-9. To check the feasibility of the planned schedule, we calculate the setup time and the produc-\ntion time for the planned number of batches and units of each product family. From Table 8-9, \nthe total planned production and setup time is 10,231.4 hours (209 for setup + 10,022.4 for pro-\nduction).

Each \nlayoff  cost  KPH  $5,000  and  each  rehiring  cost  $3,000.  \nEach  plant  generally  built  inventory  in  anticipation  of  \nthe  peak.  It  cost  $300  to  carry  a  machine  in  inventory  \nfrom one month to the next. KPH could also choose to \ndelay a customer order by stocking out in a given month \nand  filling  the  stockout  from  next  month’s  production.  \nHowever,  each  unit  delayed  in  this  manner  cost  $2,000  \nin  discounts  offered  to  customers  to  keep  them  happy.  \nThe company had a policy of ensuring that there were no \nstockouts in December so the new year started out with-\nout  any  unfilled  orders.

In many instances, plants do not operate continu-\nously and are left idle during portions of the day or week. Therefore, spare plant capacity exists \nin the form of hours when the plant is not operational. For example, many plants do not run three \nshifts,  so  the  existing  workforce  could  work  overtime  during  peak  periods  to  produce  more  to  \nmeet demand.

This  system  allows  production  from  the  plant  to  match  \ndemand from customers more closely.\n• Use of seasonal workforce: In this approach, a firm uses a temporary workforce dur-\ning the peak season to increase capacity to match demand. The tourism industry often uses sea-\nsonal workers. A base of full-time employees exists, and more are hired only for the peak season. \nToyota  regularly  uses  a  seasonal  workforce  in  Japan  to  match  supply  and  demand  better.  This  \napproach may be hard to sustain, however, if the labor market is tight.\n• Use  of  dual  facilities—specialized  and  flexible:  In  this  approach,  a  firm  uses  \nboth  specialized  and  flexible  facilities.

For instance, an electron-\nics component manufacturer might have specialized facilities for each type of circuit board \nas well as a flexible facility that can manufacture all types of circuit boards. Each special-\nized facility can produce at a relatively steady rate, with fluctuations being absorbed by the \nflexible facility.\n• Use of subcontracting: In this approach, a firm subcontracts peak production so inter-\nnal production remains level and can be done cheaply. For such an approach to work, the subcon-\ntractor  must  have  flexible  capacity  and  the  ability  to  lower  cost  by  pooling  the  fluctuations  in  \ndemand across different manufacturers.

They  rely  \ninstead on being able to purchase power from suppliers and subcontractors that have excess elec-\ntricity. This allows the power companies to maintain a level supply and, consequently, a lower \ncost.\n• Designing product flexibility into the production processes: In this approach, a firm \nhas  flexible  production  lines  whose  production  rate  can  easily  be  varied.

A  manager  must  make  the  trade-off  that  minimizes  total  cost  when  \nmaking lot-sizing decisions.\nIdeally,  cycle  inventory  decisions  should  be  made  considering  the  total  cost  across  the  \nentire supply chain. In practice, however, it is generally the case that each stage makes its cycle \ninventory decisions independently. As we discuss later in the chapter, this practice increases the \nlevel of cycle inventory as well as the total cost in the supply chain.\nKey ",

As we discuss later in the chapter, this practice increases the \nlevel of cycle inventory as well as the total cost in the supply chain.\nKey Point\nCycle  inventory  exists  in  a  supply  chain  because  different  stages  exploit  economies  of  scale  to  lower  \ntotal cost. The costs considered include material cost, fixed ordering cost, and holding cost.\nAny stage of the supply chain exploits economies of scale in its replenishment decisions in \nthe following three typical situations:\n    1.    A fixed cost is incurred each time an order is placed or produced.\n    2.    The supplier offers price discounts based on the quantity purchased per lot.\n    3.    The supplier offers short-term price discounts or holds trade promotions.\nIn the following sections, we review how purchasing managers can best respond to these \nsituations.\n11.2  eSTImaTInG CyCle InvenToRy-RelaTed CoSTS In pRaCTICe\nWhen setting cycle inventory levels in p",

Given the robustness of cycle inventory models, it is better to get a good approxi-\nmation quickly rather than spend a lot of time trying to estimate costs exactly.\nOur goal is to identify incremental costs that change with the lot-sizing decision. We can \nignore costs that are unchanged with a change in lot size. For example, if a factory is running at \n50 percent of capacity and all labor is full time and not earning overtime, it can be argued that the \nincremental  setup  cost  for  labor  is  zero.

The  appropriate  approach  is  to  evaluate  the  weighted-average \ncost of capital (WACC), which takes into account the required return on the firm’s equity \nand the cost of its debt (see Brealey and Myers, 2000). These are weighted by the amount \nof equity and debt financing that the firm has.

Fill rate is equivalent to the probability that product demand is supplied from available \ninventory. Fill rate should be measured over specified amounts of demand rather than over time. \nThus, it is more appropriate to measure fill rate over every million units of demand rather than \nevery month.

In the case of B&M, a customer may order a phone along \nwith a laptop. The order is filled from inventory only if both the phone and the laptop are avail-\nable through the store.

Thus,  \ndemand observed by different stages of the supply chain tends to be lumpy. Lumpiness adds to \nthe variability of demand.

The benefits resulting from quick response should \nbe shared appropriately across the supply chain.

Tailored sourcing may be volume based or product based, depending on \nthe source of uncertainty.\nIn volume-based tailored sourcing, the predictable part of a product’s demand is produced \nat an efficient facility, whereas the uncertain portion is produced at a flexible facility.

Their distribution network uses several ideas discussed earlier, from milk runs to \ncross-docking.\nEvery working morning around 9 a.m., about 5,000 dabbawalas use milk runs with bicy-\ncles  to  pick  up  lunches  from  about  30  homes  each.  These  freshly  made  lunches  are  packed  in  \nsteel or plastic containers called tiffins or dabbas (hence the name dabbawala, or “dabba guy”). \nEach  home  has  a  time  window  of  about  a  minute  for  the  pickup,  and  the  schedule  is  repeated  \nevery working day.

The  lunchboxes  arrive  at  the  \ndestination railway stations by about 11:30 a.m. The destination railway station serves as a hub \nfrom which crates are taken to their final destination, where the lunches will be consumed. Each \ndabbawala is responsible for delivering about 40 dabbas. This is typically done using a milk run \non a bicycle or handcart, and all deliveries are completed before 1 p.m. Once the customers finish \ntheir lunches, the entire process is repeated in reverse to return the empty dabbas to their respec-\ntive  homes  by  5  p.m.  For  this  complex  network,  in  which  150,000  individualized  pickups  and  \ndeliveries are managed daily, the dabbawalas average one delayed del",

Besides their discipline and commitment, three factors facilitate the success of the \ndabbawala distribution network:\n    1.    Low uncertainty of demand\n    2.

This temporal aggregation of demand allows the \ndabbawalas  to  ensure  that  all  pickups  or  deliveries  for  a  single  building  are  handled  together.  \nThis luxury was not available to Kozmo, which often had to go back to the same area because the \nmultiple orders that arrived from there were distributed over time. Finally, the dabbawalas use \nthe Mumbai railway system during times that are off-peak. The Mumbai railway system is one of \nthe most densely loaded systems in the world—in 2008, it carried 6.4 million passengers daily, \nwith trains packed very densely during rush hours.

The use of software to determine transportation routes has been the most \ncommon  IT  application  in  transportation.  This  software  takes  the  location  of  customers,  ship-\nment size, desired delivery times, information on the transportation infrastructure (such as dis-\ntances  between  points),  and  vehicle  capacity  as  inputs.  These  inputs  are  formulated  into  an  \noptimization problem whose solution is a set of routings and a packing list for each vehicle that \nminimize costs while meeting delivery constraints.\nAlong with routing, vehicle load optimization soft",

This flexible capacity allows the company to produce a \nvariety of low volume cars economically. In 2013, Magna Steyr assembled the G class for Mer-\ncedes, the RCZ for Peugeot, and the Mini Countryman and Mini Paceman for BMW in the same \nplant.  In  each  case,  the  models  had  relatively  low  demand  volume.  Each  firm  would  not  have  \ngained  sufficient  economies  of  scale  for  assembling  its  model.

If the scale is large, it is likely that sufficient economies of \nscale  are  achieved  internal  to  the  firm  itself.  In  this  case,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  third  party  can  \nachieve further scale economies and increase the surplus.

In  contrast,  most  firms  have  very  uncertain  demand  for  MRO  products.  They  \nprefer not to hold these items in stock and use Grainger as an intermediary.\nFinally, the growth in surplus is influenced by the specificity of assets required by the third \nparty.  If  the  assets  required  are  specific  to  a  firm  and  cannot  be  used  for  others,  a  third  party  is  \nunlikely to increase the surplus because all it does is move the assets from one firm to another.

Underestimation of the cost of coordination.

A  firm  may  lose  customer/supplier  contact  by  \nintroducing an intermediary. The loss of customer contact is particularly significant for firms that \nsell  directly  to  consumers  but  decide  to  use  a  third  party  to  either  collect  incoming  orders  or  \ndeliver outgoing product.

The  purchase  of  indirect  materials  typically  \ninvolves  many  transactions,  with  each  transaction  being  small.

A sup-\nply chain function should be outsourced if the third party can increase the supply chain surplus \nwithout significant risk. A third party may increase the surplus by aggregating capacity, inven-\ntory,  warehousing,  transportation,  information,  receivables,  and  other  factors  to  a  higher  level  \nthan the firm can on its own.

Local optimization hurts the sup-\nply  chain  surplus  when  risk  and  reward  are  not  shared  in  a  supply  chain.  Suppliers  are  more  \nlikely to act in a firm’s interest when risk and reward are shared. The use of buyback or revenue \nsharing is an effective risk sharing mechanism for products like books with low variable costs. In \ngeneral, however, quantity flexibility contracts are more effective because they result in a better \nmatching of supply and demand. When a firm wants a supplier to improve performance along \ndimensions such as lead time and quality, sharing the rewards from this improvement is a suit-\nable incentive.\n5.

It is also often the case that the \nlower-price segment can use up the entire available capacity. For example, leisure travelers tend to \nbook their tickets earlier than business travelers and most airlines could fill a plane at discount prices \ntargeting leisure travelers. It is thus important that suppliers limit the amount of capacity committed \nto lower-price buyers even if sufficient demand exists from the lower-price segment to use the entire \navailable capacity.

Business had been \nslow lately, especially during weeknights, and Mr. Chang \nwanted  to  spur  demand.  He  wanted  to  make  sure,  how-\never, that he did so in a way that actually increased profits. \nHe  estimated  that  demand  on  weeknights  was  normally  \ndistributed, with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of \n30. Given a capacity of 100 and only a single seating per \ntable per night, there were empty tables on many nights.\nGroupon and the Daily Deal\nLaunched  in  2008,  Groupon  expanded  rapidly  on  the  \nbasis of its daily deals. The daily deal amounted to a 50 to \n70  percent  discount  coupon  for  a  product  or  service  \noffered  by  a  local  business.

For instance, instead of installing a complete sup-\nply chain system across your company all at once, start first by getting your demand planning \nup and running and then move on to supply planning. Along the way, make sure each step is \nadding value through increases in the performance of the three macro processes. This incremental \napproach  does  not  mean  that  one  should  not  take  a  big-picture  perspective  (in  fact,  one  must \ntake  a  big-picture  perspective),  but  rather  that  the  big-picture  perspective  should  be  imple-\nmented in digestible pieces.\n3.

Management must \nconsider the depth to which an IT system deals with the firm’s key success factors. There is a \ntrade-off  between  the  ease  of  implementing  a  system  and  the  system’s  level  of  complexity.  \nTherefore, it is important to consider just how much sophistication a company needs to achieve \nits goals and then to ensure that the system chosen matches that level. Erring on the less sophis-\nticated side leaves the firm with a competitive weakness, whereas trying to be too sophisticated \nleads to a higher possibility of the entire system failing.\n4. Use  IT  systems  to  support  decision  making,  not  to  make  decisions.

Although it is more difficult to make a decision about an IT \nsystem with the future rather than the present in mind, managers need to include the future state \nof the business in the decision process.

This exploration can go so far as to include the \nviability of the supply chain software developer itself. If it is unclear whether a company will be \nable to get support from a software company in the future, management needs to be sure that the \nother advantages of this product outweigh this disadvantage.

Know, at a high level, how each supply chain driver uses information. Each of the \nsupply chain drivers that we have discussed in previous chapters (facilities, inventory, transporta-\ntion,  sourcing,  and  pricing)  requires  information  for  decisions  to  be  made.  Information  is  the  \nfactual  component  on  which  decisions  about  each  of  the  other  drivers  are  based.

Understand the major applications of supply chain information technology and the \nprocesses  that  they  enable.  A  company’s  supply  chain  processes  can  be  grouped  into  three  \nmain  macro  processes.  CRM  includes  processes  that  enable  interaction  between  an  enterprise  \nand its customers. ISCM includes processes focused on the internal operations of an enterprise. \nSRM  includes  processes  that  enable  interaction  between  an  enterprise  and  its  suppliers.  IT  \nenables these processes, as well as the integration across these processes. Good IT systems allow \nnot  only  the  collection  of  data  across  the  supply  chain,  but  also  the  analysis  of  decisions  that  \nmaximize supply chain profitability.\nDiscussion Questions\n  1.
